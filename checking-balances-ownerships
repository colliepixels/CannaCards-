///Checking Balances and Ownerships
///The nice thing about the Asset type is that it unifies logic between fungibles, non-fungibles, and semi-fungibles.
///Once you have an Asset, you can see how many any account owns, regardless of whether it's an ERC-20 token or a non-fungible good:

const asset = {
  tokenAddress: "0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d", // CryptoKitties
  tokenId: "1", // Token ID
}

const balance = await seaport.getAssetBalance({
  accountAddress, // string
  asset, // Asset
})

const ownsKitty = balance.greaterThan(0)

///You can use this same method for fungible ERC-20 tokens like wrapped ETH (WETH). As a convenience, you can use this fungible wrapper for checking fungible balances:

const balanceOfWETH = await seaport.getTokenBalance({
  accountAddress, // string
  tokenAddress: "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2"
})
